About eCommerce Website PHP MySQL Project:

Moving on, this E-Commerce Site Project in PHP focuses mainly on the eCommerce side of things such as online shopping and others.
Also, the system displays all the lists of products with their respective prices. In addition, the system allows managing product brands too.
This project is divided into two categories: Admin and Customer. In an overview of this web application, the customer has to register in order to perform various actions.
A customer can look for products, add products to the cart, add products to a wishlist. Each product contains its own description, features, and number of photos.
Talking about the checkout procedure, the customer can enter coupon codes for discounts. As soon as he/she passes through checkout procedures, the customer has to manage the order from the account section.

Manage Order – Customer’s Panel:

The system lists out all the orders under the account section. Each order contains its own details. These details include product name, quantity, size, amount, and current status. By default, the order’s status is set to unpaid, unless he/she completes their own payment. Here, the customer has to verify the payment for finalizing the orders. For this, the user has to provide the invoice number, banking transaction code, amount, and much more. As soon as the user proceeds through this step, the system marks the order as paid status. Additionally, the user can view and manage all their wishlist under the wishlist section. Besides, the user can view bank accounts, edit profiles, passwords, and remove their personal account.
